# Inofficial Windsurf Issues

A repository to track issues and bugs encountered with the Windsurf IDE that bother me as a user. This serves as a personal issue tracker to monitor problems and their resolution status.

## Purpose

This repository is used to:
- Document issues found in Windsurf IDE
- Track the status of these issues over time
- Close issues as they get resolved by the Windsurf/Cognition team
- Maintain a personal record of IDE improvements

## Issues

Issues will be created here to track various problems such as:
- UI/UX issues
- Performance problems
- Feature requests
- Bugs in functionality
- Integration problems

## Resolution Process

As issues are fixed by the Windsurf team:
1. The corresponding GitHub issue will be closed
2. Resolution notes may be added to document the fix
